Counters: \`pog count\` (counts pog), \`pog ecount\` (counts e), \`pog suscount\` (counts sus);

There are currently 3 counters in the bot, which count how many times you say each of these things.
The \`pog\` count is triggered whenever you say \`pog\` on its own.
The \`e\` count is triggered whenever you say \`e\` on its own.
The \`sus\` count is triggered whenever you say \`amogus\`, \`imposter\` or \`sus\` anywhere within a message.

Notice: If you mention another user that has no nickname, these commands might not work. 
Notice: Using \`pog suscount\` adds 1 more sus to the counter because using the command is sus.

Usage: \`pog count\` (to check your \`pog\` count); \`pog count [@user]\` (mention the user you want to check the \`pog\` count for)
\`pog ecount\` (to check your \`e\` count); \`pog ecount [@user]\` (mention the user you want to check the \`e\` count for)

Available Commands: \`add\`, \`subtract\`, \`multiply\`, \`divide\`, \`power\`, \`root\`

Usage:
\`pog add\` takes 2 arguments: a number, and another number that is added to it. It returns a sum.
ex. \`pog add 6 9\` → returns \`15\`

\`pog subtract\` takes 2 arguments: a number, and another number that will be subtracted from the first number. It returns a difference.
ex. \`pog subtract 9 6\` → returns \`3\`

\`pog multiply\` takes 2 arguments: a number, and another number that it is multiplied by. It returns a product.
ex. \`pog multiply 4 20\` → returns \`80\`

\`pog divide\` takes 2 arguments: a number, and another number that the first number will be divided by. It returns a quotient.
ex. \`pog divide 20 4\` → returns \`5\`

\`pog power\` takes 2 arguments: a base, and an exponent. The base is multiplied by itself the number of times specified by the exponent. 
ex. \`pog power 2 3\` → \`2³ = 2×2×2\` → returns \`8\`

\`pog root\` takes 2 arguments: a radicand, and an index. The function takes the radicand and returns it's root, depending on the index.
ex. \`pog root 8 3\` → \`³√8\` → returns \`2\`

Note: The \`power\` and \`root\` commands are a little buggy sometimes and can return a number with a lot of decimals when it isn't supposed to (ex. ³√125 returns 4.999... instead of 5)
Note: Superscripts are not enabled, therefore for powers, the exponent is denoted with a \`^\` (ex. \`2^3\` = \`2³\`)and the index of a root function is simply placed 1 space behind the root symbol (ex. \`3 √8\` = \`³√8\`)`)

No other identifiable data is stored on the server PC or GitHub.
