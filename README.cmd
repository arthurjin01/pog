Poggo

Poggo is a simple Discord bot that counts how many times users say the word 'pog', and hosts a variety of other commands.
The core function of the bot is to count how many times someone sends 'pog' into the chat, and will store each user's count on the server and backed up on GitHub.
No identifiable data is stored on the server, apart from the Discord User ID, which is used to keep track of pog counts.
\All command responses are either preset or generated on the spot (ex. exe commands are generated when the command is used, but it is not stored on the bot)
Users can use a command to get how many times they said 'pog', or get how many times a friend has said it.
This bot is still a work-in-progress; Send feedback to me on Discord -> https://discord.gg/JDTRUPP (FlyingLobster69#1861)
