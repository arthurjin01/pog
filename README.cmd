Rem pog

Rem 'pog' is a simple Discord bot that counts how many times users say the word 'pog', and hosts a variety of other commands.
Rem The core function of the bot is to count how many times someone sends 'pog' into the chat, and will read back 'Poggers!' when it detects it.
Rem Then, users can use a command to find out how many times they said 'pog', or find out how many times someone else has said it.
Rem This bot is still a work-in-progress; if you have feedback for improving the bot or the code, you can find me at https://discord.gg/JDTRUPP (LooOOooL_YT#1861)
Rem Also I am relatively new to programming in JavaScript.
