Rem pog

Rem 'pog' is a simple Discord bot that counts how many times users say the word 'pog', and hosts a variety of other commands.
Rem The core function of the bot is to count how many times someone sends 'pog' into the chat, and will store the count for each user on the server.
Rem No identifiable data is stored on the server, apart from the Discord User ID, which is used to keep track of pog counts.
Rem All command responses are either preset or generated on the spot (ex. exe commands are generated when the command is used, but it is not stored on the bot)
Rem Users can use a command to find out how many times they said 'pog', or find out how many times someone else has said it.
Rem This bot is still a work-in-progress; if you have feedback for improving the bot or the code, you can find me at https://discord.gg/JDTRUPP (LooOOooL_YT#1861)
Rem Also I am relatively new to programming in JavaScript.
